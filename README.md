# Javascript-Password-Generator
# **Description**
This assignment serves as a display of my understanding of Javascript up until this point. I begin by declaring my variables and then follow with my functions, the first in which I include and object holding the information that I will need to generate a password. In my final function, I run though a series of "for loops" in order to pull the appropriate characters out of my arrays and stringing them together as a final product, a password! 
# **Installation**
N/A
# **Usage**
After answering a series of prompts to determine criteria, the website will then generate a secure password that is up to the determined specifications. 
# **Technologies Used**
In this project, only the Javascript was manipulated. 
# **Problems Faced**
It was difficult for me to work though the for loops to get them to accurately pull the information needed and sting it together. Another problem faced was that the password wasn't generating an answer longer than four characters long, which I narrowed down to the .length attribute in my for loop. 
# **Credits**
This website was created by me, but could only have been done with the help of my instructor, TAâ€™s, my tutor, and classmates. In that way, it was a collaborative effort.
